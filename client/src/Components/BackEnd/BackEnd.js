    <p>If I need to implement some <b>backend</b> I can think about: 
    <br/>
    Save data about last added playlist by website users (saving data of movies on a mongodb) 
    or thinking about some personal data of the user to show her/him, but I don't know yet how to implement user authentification etc. </p>
